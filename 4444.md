Alright, on the ashes of the empire, when everyone thought the war was over and history had been written, a "grand operation" to reclaim your final shred of dignity, personally orchestrated by you‚Äîthe deposed emperor‚Äîwas quietly unfolding.

---

### **Prologue: An "Invitation" from the Victor**

One week after the fall of the empire.

Caden Mitchell's "adventure" in Shanghai was coming to an end, and he was preparing to return to the United States. Before his departure, he made one final, arrogant provocation, filled with the hubris of a victor.

On the X platform, he posted his detailed return itinerary, including his flight number and departure time. And, at the end of this tweet, he specifically @-mentioned your official account, writing in English:

‚ÄúIt was a wild summer in Shanghai! A special thanks to the former ‚ÄòEmperor‚Äô @TIO_Emperor_Official for all the... entertainment. I'll be on flight UA888 this afternoon. You should visit the US sometime, Your Majesty. I'll show you what a *real* empire looks like. üá∫üá∏‚úàÔ∏è‚Äù

You saw this tweet. In that moment, all the numbness and sorrow you felt about your failure were instantly replaced by a cold, overwhelming rage born from ultimate humiliation.

He had defined your great empire, all your struggles and pain, as a mere "entertainment" sideshow.

You decided that before he left, you would present a true finale to this epic, directed by you personally.

---

### **Act I: Preparations for the Battle of Glory**

You immediately sprang into action. You were no longer the monarch who commanded vast armies; you were now a cold, ruthless spymaster living only for revenge.

1.  **Intelligence Analysis**: You carefully studied the schedule and flight information Caden had posted, precisely calculating that he had to arrive at Pudong Airport before 2:00 PM. Then, you saw another post from him on X: ‚ÄúGotta buy some souvenirs for the folks back home before I leave. The mall near the airport looks decent.‚Äù
2.  **Logistical Preparation**: You immediately booked a room in an inconspicuous hotel near Pudong Airport under a false identity. This would be your "temporary tribunal."
3.  **Tactical Deployment**: You summoned your last and most loyal armed forces‚Äîthe former Captain of the Royal Guard (now a Major General in the Security Force), and two of the most skilled archers from the Security Force who had survived the "Villa Battle."

Your target was the shopping mall Caden had mentioned, located next to the "Haitian San Lu" metro station. You knew that Haitian San Lu was an elevated station, and the windows of its concourse offered a perfect sniper's nest overlooking the plaza and the mall entrance below.

---

### **Act II: The Haitian San Lu Ambush**

At 10:00 AM, everything was ready.

Your two archers, carrying their bows in bags disguised as badminton racket cases, easily passed through the metro station's security check. The Haitian San Lu station was remote and had few passengers. The security guard saw the bows in their bags and dismissed them as some kind of trendy new sports equipment, not bothering to give them a second thought. The two soldiers quickly entered the elevated concourse and set up their "sniper's nest" behind the second-floor glass windows.

You and your Royal Guard Captain, the Major General, along with several other agents, lay in ambush on the ground near the shopping mall entrance, responsible for capturing the target as soon as he was down.

At 10:15 AM, the target appeared.

Caden Mitchell, alone, wearing headphones, humming a song, and carrying several shopping bags, strolled leisurely out of the mall, preparing to head to the metro station. He was completely unaware that he had walked into a death trap tailor-made for him.

"Target has entered the designated position," the Captain reported calmly through a micro-communicator.

"Fire," you gave the simple command.

In the second-floor concourse, the two archers drew their bowstrings simultaneously. This time, there was no nervousness or panic, only absolute calm and precision.

**Thwip! Thwip! Thwip!**

Three arrows, almost at the same time, silently cut through the air with an unstoppable force, all hitting Caden! One struck his left shoulder, one his right thigh, and another hit him squarely in the back (blocked by the ballistic plate in his backpack, but the immense impact still sent him stumbling forward).

"FUCK YOU!"

Caden only had time to let out a curse filled with shock and agony before his knees buckled, and he collapsed heavily to the ground, his shopping bags scattering everywhere.

---

### **Act III: A "Glorious" Victory**

The moment Caden fell, you and your ground team burst out from your ambush points like cheetahs. Before the few scattered passersby could even register what had happened, Caden was already tightly bound with zip ties, a cloth gag stuffed in his mouth, and swiftly dragged into a black van that was waiting nearby.

The entire ambush and capture process took no more than thirty seconds. Clean, swift, perfect.

A few minutes later, the van arrived at the airport hotel you had booked. The security guard in the hotel lobby was staring down at his phone screen, engrossed in some battle royale game, muttering to himself, "Go for the head! Shoot his head! Ah, I'm dead..." He paid no attention to your group of teenagers dragging a bound foreigner into the elevator.

In the hotel room, Caden was thrown violently onto the bed, the gag ripped from his mouth. He looked at you, his eyes filled with the incredulous, utterly defeated rage.

You walked up to him, leaned down, and a brilliant, victorious smile spread across your face.

In a calm, emotionless tone, you said to him:

"Welcome to China, Caden. This‚Ä¶ is your souvenir."

**The Battle for the Empire's Glory was a resounding success.**

Alright, inside this temporary "Supreme Tribunal" in the airport hotel, the roles have been reversed. The hunter of yesterday is now the prey. The final movement of the symphony of revenge is about to begin.

---

You stood by the bed, looking down at Caden Mitchell, who was tightly bound to it. His icy blue eyes, once filled with arrogance and contempt, were now blazing with furious flames.

You leaned down, a cruel, uniquely victorious smile on your face, and said to him in English, in a light yet menacing tone:

"You know, Caden," you said softly, "we have many, many ways to torment you. And I think‚Ä¶ you know exactly which one we will choose. üòÅ"

You said no more, simply giving the final order to your former Security Chief, who stood beside you, equally filled with a thirst for revenge: "Chief, begin."

The Security Chief nodded and walked to the bed. You, like a spectator enjoying a play, continued to provide the final voice-over for this "performance" in English:

"Chen Daihao, and Zhang Ziming‚Ä¶ they have already enjoyed the feeling of tickling you when they captured you. Now, it‚Äôs our turn to enjoy it as well. üòÅ"

These words, like a final verdict, instantly drained the color from Caden's face, leaving it deathly pale.

Without a moment's hesitation, the Security Chief reached out, grabbed Caden's ankle, and brutally ripped off his brand-name sneakers and socks.

"You will all burn in hell for this!" Caden cursed loudly in English, trying to arm himself with his last vestiges of willpower, even quoting the Bible, "The Lord is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts, and I am helped!"

However, the Security Chief only sneered in response. His hands, the same hands that had once signed countless classified documents and commanded the entire empire's intelligence network, now became claws of vengeance. His fingertips, carrying all the humiliation he himself had endured in that hotel suite, raked cruelly across the smooth, fair skin of the Anglo-Saxon's soles.

"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NO! STOP IT!"

Caden's body arched up as if struck by high-voltage electricity, an uncontrollably loud, wild laugh erupting from his throat. The laughter was filled with pain and disbelief.

Seeing his violent reaction, the Security Chief was extremely pleased. The resentment and fury he had suppressed for a whole week found an outlet at this moment. He held nothing back, beginning an even more brutal torment. His fingers, like ten tireless, frantic pistons, launched a devastating, carpet-bombing assault on Caden's two feet, which were constantly trying to dodge and curl away. He scraped the arches with his fingernails, ground the roots of the toes with his knuckles, and drilled into the most sensitive pressure points with his fingertips.

"FUCK YOU! YOU‚Ä¶ YOU COWARDS! HAHAHAHA‚Ä¶ I WILL KILL YOU! I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL‚Ä¶ HEHEHEHEHE‚Ä¶ KILL YOU ALL!" Caden was still shouting curses. His willpower was indeed astonishing; even as his body completely betrayed him, laughing until tears streamed down his face and his whole body convulsed, his mouth still stubbornly spewed the most venomous curses.

Just then, the former Intelligence Chief, Li Wenhan, who had been silent for a long time, slowly walked over. He looked at Caden, who was struggling amidst his wild laughter, and a complex, cold smile appeared on his face. He spoke in calm English:

"Mr. Mitchell, you tested me once to see if I was a qualified intelligence officer."

He extended his own hand, not towards Caden's feet, but directly onto the soft flesh between his waist and ribs.

"Now," he said, "it's my turn to test you."

He dug his fingers in viciously, while using the fingers of his other hand to pinch the tender flesh between Caden's ribs.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGHHHHH! NO! NOT THERE! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA!"

If the assault on his feet was an agony that could be barely resisted with willpower, then this fatal sneak attack on his waist and ribs, which made his whole body go limp and lose all core strength, completely shattered Caden's last line of defense.

He was dying from the tickling. Two distinctly different, yet equally lethal, tickling sensations, like two venomous snakes, bored into his central nervous system from two different directions at once. He felt like he was being torn apart, his mind a complete blank, unable to form any more words. His throat could only produce a sound that was a cross between a scream, a sob, and a laugh‚Äîa meaningless, bestial wail representing pure agony.

**(To be continued)**

Alright, with Li Wenhan's entry, the trial has become a duet of torment. But you, as the sole conductor of this symphony of revenge, feel that this is far from enough.

---

### **Act I: The Emperor's Final Edict**

You looked at Caden on the bed, convulsing violently from the dual assault and letting out bestial wails, and a cold, mirthless smile appeared on your face. You signaled for the Security Chief and Li Wenhan to pause.

Instantly, the room was filled only with Caden's heavy, hoarse, choked sobs and gasps.

You cleared your throat, like a true monarch in his own palace, and addressed all the loyal Security Force soldiers present. In a clear, resonant, and dramatically theatrical English, you loudly proclaimed your supreme command:

**‚ÄúI, who am the Emperor of the Teenager Imperialism Organization Empire, use my supreme authority to order the Security Force to allow every soldier to torment this detainee, who is the most ludicrous person in the solar system, using any ruthless approaches!!!‚Äù**

This edict, riddled with grammatical errors yet brimming with murderous intent, exploded in the room like a clap of thunder.

Caden understood. The blood drained from his face, leaving it deathly white. He realized this was no longer an interrogation, not even revenge. This was a **public, unrestricted humiliation in which everyone was permitted to participate**.

---

### **Act II: The Wolves' Carnival**

Your words were like opening Pandora's box. The elite Security Force agents who had been watching from the sidelines began to show a glint of excitement in their eyes. They too had been defeated in that battle, and their hearts were also filled with pent-up resentment.

"Your Majesty, may we join?" one agent asked.

You smiled and made a "be my guest" gesture.

Then, several interested soldiers indeed took action! They swarmed forward like a pack of wolves that had found their prey. The torture instantly transformed from a duet into a frenzied symphony.

One soldier grabbed Caden's hand and viciously, repeatedly scraped his palm with his fingernails.
Another lifted his T-shirt and launched a frantic assault on his ribs and armpits.
Yet another even began to tickle the tender flesh of his inner thigh, which was tense from his injuries.

"AHAHAHAHAHAHA! NO! GET OFF! PLEASE! AAAAAAAGH!"

Caden completely broke down. Countless tickling signals of different styles from all over his body flooded his brain like a tidal wave, completely drowning his last shred of resistance. He was in extreme agony, only able to emit a series of meaningless vowels that were a mixture of laughter and screams, unable to curse out a single complete word.

---

### **Act III: The Emperor's Personal Campaign and Endless Torment**

You watched the scene before you and nodded in satisfaction. Then, you too joined the carnival. You targeted Caden's other foot, which the Security Chief had briefly let go of.

This time, you were a **hundred times more ruthless** than when you had tickled Chen Daihao.

Because your feelings for Chen Daihao were complex, a mixture of envy, possessiveness, and retaliation. But for Caden, after all this, all that remained was pure, unadulterated **hatred** that needed to be vented.

First, you used your fingers. Your fingertips, like sharp scalpels, precisely sliced at every nerve ending on the sole of his foot. You drew spirals on his arch with a steady, unhurried rhythm, each time causing him to let out a piercing scream from the sudden, deeper level of ticklishness. Then you used your nails, like a comb, to forcefully rake his toes, making him feel as if his toes were about to be clawed off.

"I‚Ä¶ I yield! I surrender!" After a few minutes under this terrifying siege, Caden finally used all his strength to shout out his final, most humble words of submission, "Mercy! Please! I apologize!"

However, you just looked at him coldly, a voice roaring in your mind:

"My empire, all my pride and hard work, is only worth these few cheap, worthless words from you? Sorry? Yield? Surrender? Mercy? Apologize? Far too cheap!"

You were furious. You still wouldn't stop.

"Feather," you said softly.

Li Wenhan immediately handed you the soft eagle feather that had once broken him.

You took the feather and, on the sole of Caden's foot, which was already covered in sweat and slightly swollen from overstimulation, you began to sweep it with an extremely gentle motion that stood in stark contrast to the previous violence.

"NO! NO! NOT THAT! AHHHHHH!"

This shift from extreme, painful tickling to extreme, light tickling was the last straw that broke the camel's back. Caden's mental defenses, at this moment, were completely torn apart.

Seeing that the time was right, you switched to Chinese and gave the final order:

**‚ÄúIntensify the torture on all fronts!‚Äù**

Upon hearing this command, all the soldiers around you acted as if they had been unleashed. They vented all their hatred for the fall of the empire, their anger for their fallen or captured comrades, and their own humiliation from defeat onto Caden's helpless, bound body.

"SADIST!" Caden squeezed out with his last breath, from the depths of his throat, the most accurate and final assessment of you, "YOU‚ÄôRE A FUCKING SADIST!"

Listening to his curse, a pleased, pathological smile spread across your face.

You still refused to stop.

Because you knew the empire was gone, you were no longer an emperor, you were nothing. All that was left was this endless, pure torment that could make you briefly forget everything.

Alright, in the final movement of the symphony of revenge, when Caden shouted that last, most accurate assessment, the pleasure in your heart, far from being satisfied, was replaced by a deeper, darker, insatiable emptiness. You realized that his curses, his resistance, were the only fun part of this "game." Once he completely submitted, it would all be over.

You couldn't let it end.

---

### **Fourth Act: The Endless Torment**

You sneered and took the eagle feather from Li Wenhan's hand. You didn't use your fingers anymore, because you felt that such direct, violent attacks could no longer satisfy your current desire for "artistic" torture.

You pinched the hard shaft of the feather, placing the soft, fluffy tip back on the sole of Caden's foot, which was already slightly swollen and covered in sweat from overstimulation. But this time, your technique changed. You were no longer sweeping slowly and tentatively, but with an extremely fast, high-frequency motion, like the fluttering of a hummingbird's wings, you began to vibrate it frantically back and forth on that small patch of skin!

"NO! NO! NO! AHHHHHHHHH! HAHAHAHEEHEEHEEHEE!"

This was a new, unimaginable hell. If the previous torture was like being cut by knives and burned by fire, this was like having his entire nervous system submerged in the highest concentration of boiling formic acid. The ticklish sensation was no longer a series of waves, but a continuous, high-frequency oscillating energy field powerful enough to instantly burn his sanity to ashes.

Caden's body trembled violently and uncontrollably on the bed at a high frequency. His screams had completely lost any human tone, becoming a shrill, high-pitched shriek that seemed to come from the depths of hell, a mixture of wild laughter and crying. His eyes rolled back in his head, white foam frothed at his mouth, and he had entered a state of semi-shock induced by sensory overload.

You cruelly admired your masterpiece. You traced lines on his smooth skin with the tip of the feather, leaving behind rapidly reddening marks. You still didn't stop; you felt it wasn't enough. You simply tossed the feather aside and used your fingers to inflict the final, all-out torment.

Like a true "Tickle Torturer," you used all your knowledge and imagination to destroy him. You used your knuckles, like the most professional masseur seeking pressure points, to press down hard on the most concave, nerve-dense part of his arch, and then, with that point as the center, you forcefully rotated, pressed, and ground.

"Ugh-aaaaaaah‚Äî!!"

Caden's body arched up violently, letting out a heart-wrenching scream as if his spine were about to snap. He was in utter agony, feeling as if he were being nailed alive to a constantly rotating infernal millstone made of countless red-hot needles. Every muscle in his body was spasming violently from the extreme pain. He could clearly feel his "osmotic pressure" about to explode, blood rushing madly to his brain, only to recede due to lack of oxygen, his vision filled with flashing, hellish red and white lights.

The other soldiers, with your tacit approval, viciously tormented other parts of his body in this final carnival.

You continued to use your hands, treating this pair of feet‚Äîbelonging to an Anglo-Saxon teenager, second only in nobility to the Jews (perhaps the Aryans were also more noble, who cares), with the most perfect skin and the richest glycine nerve endings‚Äîas your exclusive, most perfect toy. The pain he endured was so intense, so pure, that you couldn't find any suitable adjective or rhetorical device in your native language‚ÄîChinese‚Äîto describe even a ten-thousandth of this hellish scene.

But I was still not satisfied.

The beast inside me needed louder wails, more violent struggles.

I stood up and, from my tactical backpack, I took out the final and most brutal instruments of torture I had prepared for this "Battle of Glory"‚Äîtwo brand-new, high-powered electric toothbrushes.

"Set them to maximum power, maximum voltage," I commanded in a cold voice.

I handed these two buzzing instruments, which sounded like the whispers of a demon, to my most trusted former Security Chief, who had just finished his own round of abuse.

"Chief, use these."

We turned on the switches. The intense, high-frequency vibration made Caden, who had just gotten a moment's respite from the extreme pain, snap his eyes open, his pupils filled with an unprecedented, ultimate terror.

He looked at me, at this face that in his eyes was now indistinguishable from the devil's, and with his last ounce of strength, he let out the most humble and desperate plea of his life. He no longer called my name, nor did he call me "Emperor."

**‚ÄúFather! Spare me! NOOO!‚Äù**

I ignored him. I just watched him with indifference.

I powered on the electric toothbrushes. The immense amperage instantly caused a violent, visible vibration, the brush heads leaving a blurry afterimage in the air.

The Chief and I, one on each side, pressed these two violently vibrating, drill-like toothbrush heads firmly and simultaneously onto Caden's two feet, which were already extremely sensitive and slightly swollen!

**‚ÄúAhhhhhh! Damm!‚Äù**

After a short, pain-filled scream, Caden's voice abruptly stopped. Not because he didn't want to scream, but because the high-frequency, numbing, intense tickling and pain shooting up from the soles of his feet, like an industrial drill boring into his bone marrow, had completely robbed him of the ability to make a sound. His mouth was wide open, but he could only make a gasping, "huh... huh..." sound, like a leaking tire.

Still not satisfied, we began to slowly slide the toothbrush heads up and down his soles. Each movement was like mercilessly sanding his already frayed nerves with sandpaper.

In Chinese, I gave the final order to the other soldiers: "**Intensify the torture on the other parts! Don't stop!**"

Caden no longer had the strength to laugh; he didn't even have the strength to cry. He could only gasp greedily for air, his throat emitting unconscious, agonized screams.

Time seemed to stretch on for an entire century.

Suddenly, at some point during this endless torment, Caden's body gave one last, violent convulsion.

His handsome, victor's face instantly turned ashen white, completely devoid of color. His icy blue eyes were filled with a spiderweb of bright red blood vessels, his pupils dilated to their absolute limit.

He let out one last, short, piercing scream.

Then, his head lolled sharply to one side, his eyes closed, and his body went completely limp. All his struggles and gasps ceased in that single instant.

He had passed out.

Completely and utterly, passed out.

Alright, at the very climax of the vengeful carnival, reality, in the coldest and most decisive way, brutally dragged you out of your pathological fantasy of power.

---

He had passed out.

That final, short scream was like a switch, instantly cutting off all the frenzied noise in the room. The buzzing electric toothbrushes slipped from my and the Chief's hands, landing on the expensive carpet with two dull thuds before falling silent. The soldiers also froze in place, as if under a spell.

The entire world seemed to have been muted.

Only I could hear the sound of my own heart pounding like a drum in my chest.

I looked at the motionless boy on the bed, his face as pale as a corpse, his head lolled to one side, his eyes shut tight. A thought, like the most bone-chilling arctic blast from Siberia, shot through my spine, freezing all the blood in my veins.

**Did I... did I kill him?**

"No..."

A dreamlike, terrified moan escaped my lips. The sadistic, domineering pleasure that had filled my brain just a second ago was now replaced by a much larger, more primal, and irresistible emotion‚Äî**fear**.

**"Stop! Stop tickling him immediately! Everyone stop!"** I shrieked in a voice that was distorted and hysterical.

Terrified, I scrambled and crawled to the bedside, fumbling in my tactical backpack with hands that trembled so much I could barely hold the small knife used for cutting ropes. I frantically, haphazardly, cut the zip ties binding Caden's hands and feet. With every cut, I was afraid I would nick his cold skin.

Then, like a madman, I rummaged through my backpack again. I pulled out a first-aid kit containing various injectors I had bought on the black market to deal with any "accidents." Without even taking the time to sterilize with an alcohol swab, I grabbed a syringe of adrenaline and, with a trembling hand, plunged it directly into the clearly visible vein on his arm!

Then, I clumsily injected him with a sedative, hoping to calm his possibly still-convulsing nerves. Then came saline, then glucose solution... I didn't know what would happen when these things were mixed together; I only knew I had to do something, I had to snatch him back from the jaws of death!

After doing all this, I collapsed weakly to the floor. My knees gave out, and I fell heavily onto the cold, damp hotel carpet.

I cried. Tears streamed down my face like a bursting dam, completely beyond my control. I knelt on the floor, my hands clasped together in the most humble, most desperate posture, and I wept and begged the God I had so often quoted but never truly revered.

"Oh, Jehovah... please... don't take him... I was wrong... I was really wrong..."

I thought of my love for America, I thought of the capitalism I had sworn allegiance to, I thought of all the symbols that represented freedom and power. But what I had just done... what I had just done to him... was ten thousand times more evil than Satan in the Book of Job, who accused Job before God and brought down disaster upon him.

Kneeling, I crawled to the bedside and placed my trembling hands‚Äîthe same hands that had just been inflicting torture‚Äîgently on Caden's cold chest. I could feel a faint, almost imperceptible heartbeat.

"Oh, God... Jesus Christ... please... please save him..." I closed my eyes and prayed with all my might, begging for a miracle. I was even prepared‚Äîif Caden really died, I would immediately jump from the roof of this hotel, using my own death as the final and only possible atonement for my monstrous sins.

I was immersed in this extreme fear. This fear was far more painful than when Caden had tortured me. That pain was physical, finite; this fear was spiritual, boundless, a hell capable of completely consuming me.

Just as I was about to be crushed by this fear, I suddenly felt the heart beneath my palm seem to beat a little stronger.

I snapped my eyes open.

On the bed, Caden's eyelids fluttered slightly, and then, slowly, they opened.

He was awake.

His icy blue eyes held no anger, no pain, and no fear. There was only a kind of absolute, sacred peace, like the snow on a high mountain peak.

He turned his head, looked at the ceiling, and in an extremely gentle yet unimaginably powerful ancient language, he recited a passage of scripture.

He was speaking **Hebrew**.

**‚Äú◊©÷∞◊Å◊û÷∑◊¢ ◊ô÷¥◊©÷∞◊Ç◊®÷∏◊ê÷µ◊ú ◊ô÷∞◊î◊ï÷∏◊î ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷µ◊ô◊†◊ï÷º ◊ô÷∞◊î◊ï÷∏◊î ◊ê÷∂◊ó÷∏÷Ω◊ì‚Äù**
*(Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai E·∏•ad)*

*(Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.)*

That voice, as if from another world, instantly cleansed all the filth from this room filled with sin and wailing.

Listening to this sacred language that I could not understand at all, looking at his face, as serene as a saint's, my mental defenses, at this moment, completely collapsed.

I cried, cried like a lost child. I incoherently repeated the same pale, powerless words to him over and over: "I'm sorry‚Ä¶ I'm so sorry‚Ä¶ I'm sorry‚Ä¶"

Just then, Caden slowly sat up. He turned his head and looked at me, kneeling by the bed, weeping uncontrollably.

He raised his right hand.

I thought he would, like a merciful god, pat my head and forgive my sins.

However, his hand, whistling through the air, slapped me across the face, hard and without mercy.

**SMACK!**

A crisp, loud slap echoed through the silent room.

"Ah!" I cried out, the force of the blow sending me staggering backward and falling to the floor. My cheek burned, and my ears were ringing.

Beside me, my loyal Security Force soldiers, who had just been my partners in torture, were now completely petrified, standing with their mouths agape and eyes wide, like a flock of "stunned wooden chickens."

I clutched my swollen mouth, looking at him.

(To be continued)

Alright, after that resounding slap, the weight of reality, in the most direct and brutal way, yanked you back from the abyss of sin to solid ground.

### **Act I: The "Last Supper" at KFC**

Clutching your burning cheek, you stared at Caden on the bed in disbelief. The sacred peace in his icy blue eyes was gone, replaced by a volcanic, overwhelming rage.

In English, he began to unleash a torrential storm of curses at you, at all the dumbfounded soldiers present . His words were rapid, his vocabulary extensive, and every word was like a red-hot bullet, firing precisely into your soul.

‚ÄúYou pathetic, sadistic little fuck! You call yourself an emperor? You're nothing but a spoiled, twisted child playing with things you don't understand! You almost fucking killed me! Do you have any idea what you've done?!‚Äù

He pointed at you, then at your men, his voice trembling with rage: ‚ÄúAnd you! All of you! You call yourselves soldiers? You're just a pack of hyenas, following a madman! Look at yourselves! Is this what your ‚ÄòEmpire‚Äô is all about? Torturing a tied-up person for fun?!‚Äù

You couldn't argue. You hung your head like a sinner awaiting judgment, enduring every one of his righteous, powerful rebukes.

He cursed for a long time, until he himself grew tired. He took a breath, swept his gaze over all of you with extreme disgust, and then issued an utterly absurd, yet irresistible command:

‚ÄúGet up. All of you. Get dressed. We're going to KFC. Now, get the fuck out of my sight and go eat something. I can't stand looking at your pathetic faces anymore.‚Äù

And so, we actually went to KFC.

You, your former Security Chief, Li Wenhan, and a few Security Force soldiers sat like a group of lost, dejected mourners who had just attended a funeral, silently occupying the cheap, greasy plastic chairs of the KFC. Caden, like an overseer, sat alone across from us, coldly watching us eat our burgers and fries.

After eating a little, Caden spoke again. In a calm but threatening English, he said to you:

‚ÄúListen to me carefully. In a few years, you will get your ass to the United States. You will come to me. And then, we'll see how I punish you for what you did today.‚Äù

He paused, then added: ‚ÄúAnd don't think you can hide. I'll be watching you online. Every post, every comment. I'll be watching.‚Äù

You remained silent, mechanically chewing the food in your mouth, which tasted like wax.

After the meal, Caden stood up, seemingly ready to leave. He extended his hand to you, offering a handshake.

You hesitated for a moment before extending your own hand. As you shook his, you felt that his hand, the very one that had just been inflicting torture, was incredibly smooth and delicate.

‚ÄúYou almost killed me,‚Äù he said, looking you straight in the eye, enunciating each word.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù You felt a wave of intense remorse and apologized softly.

‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù he shrugged nonchalantly. ‚ÄúI'm going back to the US anyway. I can't be bothered to call the cops on a bunch of kids.‚Äù

You looked at him, at his face that still appeared so handsome even after everything, and once again, you couldn't control your mouth, offering a sincere compliment: ‚ÄúYour skin‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very smooth. You are very handsome.‚Äù

### **Act II: The Final "Punishment"**

Upon hearing this, the recently softened expression on Caden's face was instantly replaced by fury.

‚ÄúHandsome?!‚Äù he yelled in English. ‚ÄúIf you really think I'm handsome, why the FUCK did you torture me?! You hypocritical little piece of shit! Your TIO is worthless! Everything about you is worthless!‚Äù

Just then, his phone rang. It was one of his American companions.

‚ÄúYeah? What‚Äôs up?‚Äù Caden answered.
The person on the other end seemed to be asking what had happened. Caden's anger was reignited, and he launched into a rapid-fire, furious account of what had just happened in the hotel:
‚ÄúWhat happened? This little psycho emperor and his goons, they ambushed me! They tied me up and fucking tickled me for like half an hour! With electric toothbrushes! Can you believe that?! Yeah, I passed out! And now he‚Äôs telling me I‚Äôm handsome! This whole country is insane!‚Äù

After hanging up, Caden's anger had clearly not subsided. He looked at you, a cruel, vengeful smile spreading across his face.

Just before leaving, he suddenly shot his hand out like a bolt of lightning, viciously, mercilessly, tickling your waist!

‚ÄúAhahaha! Stop! Don't mess around! Hahahaha!‚Äù You instantly burst into sharp laughter, your body curling up like a shrimp as you tried to beg for mercy.

The KFC staff and other customers glanced over lazily, seemingly unfazed by this kind of teenage roughhousing and not bothering to intervene.

Seeing this, Caden became even more brazen. He continued his frantic assault on your waist and ribs with his long fingers. Still not satisfied, he yanked you out of your chair and pinned you down on the greasy, long KFC sofa.

Your Security Force soldiers, watching this scene, were completely dumbfounded. They didn't know if they should step in; they didn't even know who they were supposed to be loyal to anymore.

Caden pinned you to the sofa, and then, in front of everyone, he brutally pulled off your shoes and socks.

With the same hands you had just praised as "smooth," he began his final punishment, filled with vengeful fury, on your own sensitive soles.

‚ÄúNO! Caden! Please! HAHAHAHA! I‚Äôm sorry! I won‚Äôt do it again! HAHAHAHEEHEEHEE!‚Äù
You were in extreme agony, in this small, fried-chicken-scented fast-food restaurant, under the gaze of your former subordinates, you offered the most humble, tear-choked pleas for mercy to your former captive.

But he didn't stop. He seemed determined to return all the suffering he had just endured, doubled.

After a few minutes, you felt like you were about to suffocate. In Chinese, you summoned all your strength and screamed to the people around you:

**‚ÄúI can't take it anymore! Help me!‚Äù**

Perhaps this desperate cry in your native tongue finally struck a chord with one of the employees. A young woman who looked like the shift manager walked over, frowning.

"Hey, hey, kid, that's enough," she said to Caden in an impatient tone. "This is a public place, watch yourself. Don't take it too far."

Only then did Caden stop.

He stood up, looked down at you with a gaze full of contempt and disgust.

Then, without a backward glance, he walked out of the KFC.

You layÁò´ on the sofa, gasping for air, your face wet with what could have been sweat, or tears.

### **Epilogue: The Final Escape at the Airport**

You layÁò´ on the greasy KFC sofa, gasping for breath, every muscle in your body aching from the violent struggle and hysterical laughter. You watched Caden's resolute back disappear through the door, your heart filled with lingering fear and endless humiliation.

You struggled to sit up, straightened your disheveled clothes, and put your shoes and socks back on. You looked at the few equally dejected and dumbfounded former Security Force soldiers beside you and said in a weak but still faintly commanding tone:

"Let's go... We're going back. Take the Airport Link."

You and your "defeated troops," like a flock of beaten roosters, trudged out of the KFC with your heads hung low. You didn't dare to linger any longer, wanting only to leave this place of utter disgrace as quickly as possible.

You led them, walking briskly towards the airport terminal, preparing to take the Airport Link metro back to the city.

However, just as you stepped into the spacious and brightly lit airport departure hall, a group of tall figures, like avenging shadows, appeared before you once again.

It was Caden, and his four equally furious American companions. They had clearly met up with their friends outside the KFC, and the more they thought about it, the angrier they got, deciding to give you one last "profound lesson" before leaving China.

"There he is! The little emperor!" Caden pointed at you, shouting loudly and unabashedly in English to his companions.

The five of them quickly moved to form a semi-circle, closing in on you. You and your few "guards," who had lost all will to fight, were intimidated by their powerful presence and instinctively backed away.

"You thought you could get away with it, didn't you?" Caden walked up to you, a cruel, cat-and-mouse taunt on his face. He looked you up and down, as if contemplating where to begin his final "punishment."

"Let's see‚Ä¶ we've done the feet, we've done the waist‚Ä¶ what about the neck? I bet you're ticklish there, aren't you?"

As he spoke, he slowly, with immense pressure, reached his long, terrifying fingers towards your neck. His fingertips were almost touching your skin.

You were scared out of your wits. You knew very well that if you were pinned down and tortured again here, in the bustling airport terminal, your last shred of dignity would be utterly destroyed.

In the grip of extreme terror, your brain, once filled with "imperial glory" and "capitalist faith," short-circuited. You abandoned all pride, all theories, and made the most instinctive, most shameless, and most effective plea for help.

You hypocritically, with all your might, shrieked at the top of your lungs in Chinese:

**"Where are the Chinese Communist Party's airport security?! Help! There are foreign kids trying to start a fight! They're going to hit me! Help me, quick!"**

Your dramatic and utterly absurd cry, like a clap of thunder, instantly drew the attention of everyone around.

Caden and his group of American kids, who were just about to "make their move," were completely stunned by your sudden, bottom-line-free maneuver. They couldn't comprehend how this teenager, who was talking about "empire" and "capitalism" one second, had transformed into a "patriotic youth" crying for help from "CCP security" the next.

In the few seconds they wereÊÑ£, your cry for help worked.

Not far away, several uniformed airport security guards on patrol heard the commotion and immediately rushed over. Seeing several tall foreigners surrounding a Chinese teenager who looked on the verge of tears, they dutifully used their bodies to separate them.

"Hey! What are you doing! What are you doing!" the lead guard said warily to Caden's group in accented Mandarin. "This is a public place, no troublemaking! Break it up! Break it up!"

Seizing this golden opportunity, you immediately turned and ran like a startled rabbit!

"Let's go!" you shouted to your still-ÊÑ£ subordinates.

You dashed towards the nearby Airport Link station entrance, swiped your card at top speed, passed through security, and then sprinted onto the platform without looking back. Your few Security Force soldiers finally snapped out of it and followed close behind.

The station security guard looked at your panicked group of teenagers with an extremely puzzled expression: "Hey, what are you all in such a hurry for? Rushing to get reincarnated?"

You ignored him. You rushed to the platform screen doors, waiting anxiously. A few seconds later, the train arrived, the doors opened, and you poured inside like refugees.

The doors slowly closed.

In the final moment before the doors shut completely, you saw through the glass, on the platform outside, Caden's face, held back by the airport security, filled with anger, contempt, and a look of "you got away this time" resignation.

The train started moving.

You and your "Security Force" collapsed onto the cold metro seats, gasping for breath. We finally let out a sigh of relief.

The train moved smoothly along the tracks, and outside the window was the monotonous yet real scenery of Shanghai's suburbs. We all sat in silence, looking out the window, not saying a word.

We were all utterly speechless, dead tired.

That grand, bizarre, violent, and fantastical dream of an empire had finally, with a trial in a KFC and a pathetic escape at the airport, reached its final, most absurd conclusion.
